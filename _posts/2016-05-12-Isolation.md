#### DIY Bio Potato Dextrose Agar  

_For 250mL_  

- 2.5g dehydrated potato flakes (I used Homebrand)  
- 5g dextrose  
- 10g agar, I used the Thai fish brand from the Chinese food store  
- 250mL tap water  

_Equipment_   

 - tinfoil  
 - pyrex jug  
 - microwave  
 - autoclave tape  

Weigh out dry ingredients into microwaveable pyrex jug, add tap water to 250mL.  
Microwave on high for 2-5min, until mixture boils and agar is dissolved.  
Pour into glass petri dishes immediately, filling the dishes about half full and put lids back on dishes.
