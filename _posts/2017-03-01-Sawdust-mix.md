![hero shot]({{site.baseurl}}{{site.imageurl}}{{page.image}}20170215_153858.jpg)

_Equipment:_   

 - 10 litre bucket
 - oven bags
 - microwave or pressure cooker to sterilise
 - autoclave tape  
 - thick waterproof gloves  
 - cotton wool  
 - pyrex jug  

_Ingredients:_  

 - 9 cups of sawdust
 - 1.5 cups of wheat bran
 - 1.5 cups of oat bran
 - 9.9g gypsum (calcium sulphate)
 - 9.9g raw sugar

_Optional enriched media:_  

 - Replace water with potato-dextrose broth.

#### Method:
Mix all ingredients together in 10 litre bucket, except for raw sugar.  

Add raw sugar to the pyrex jug and dissolve in water.

Add water-sugar mix to dry mix and add water until you can just squeeze drops of moisture out of the media when you squeeze a handful hard in your fist.  `note to self: give guide for roughly how much water to use`

Fill oven bags Â¼ full with sawdust media, pack down slightly.  

Leave 1/8 bag of headspace, then put cotton wool plug in top of bag, wrap firmly with autoclave tape or masking tape.  

Put in another oven bag to sterilise, as oven bags tear easily.  

Sterilise using [pressure cooker or microwave]({{ site.baseurl }}/procedure/Sterilisation.html) method.
