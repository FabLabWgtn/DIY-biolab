FAB FUNgus
Fungi from Otari are being used in an exciting research project to create food and other materials from clean waste streams. Pure cultures of wood rotting fungi from Otari are key to the success of the project, linking the natural world with contemporary design practice.
The instigating team includes mycologist Alison Stringer, and designers Wendy Neale and Craig Hobern at Massey University's digital fabrication space, Fab Lab Wgtn.
The project is part of their overarching Resilience Project, reducing and re-using waste produced at Fab Lab Wgtn, much of their food and wood waste is diverted to their on-site worm farms.
Their aims are to cultivate edible fungi on wood waste and other clean waste like coffee grinds and excess paper. Biomaterials and speeding up compost production will also be part of the project. They also aim to involve the broader community in this experiment, so keep your eyes open for updates if youâ€™d like to be involved.
