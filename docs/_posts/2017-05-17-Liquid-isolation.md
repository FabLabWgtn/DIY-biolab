# Liquid Isolation

`hero shot goes here`  

_Equipment:_  

 - 8 jars of [liquid media]({{site.baseurl}}/media/Liquid-media.html) (sterilised and room temperature)
 - 1-2 plates of pure culture  
 - camp stove or bunsen burner

#### Method:

[Reset and sterilise]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.url }}/#) your work environment.  
Sterilise the scalpel by holding it in the camp stove flame for a few seconds.

Carefully lift the lid of a pure culture. Cool the scalpel by inserting it into agar at the edge of the dish away from the culture.
Cut a small square of new growth from near the edge of the culture, about 3mm across. Try not to scoop up too much agar.

Replace the lid on the pure culture and open the jar of liquid media.  
Gently shake the culture square into the liquid. Swirl to ensure it is not stuck to the sides or bottom.

Leave jars on a vibrating surface or swirl daily to agitate and aerate liquid.
