_Equipment:_

 - pyrex jug  
 - microwave  
 - autoclave tape  

#### Method:

Weigh out dry ingredients into microwaveable pyrex jug, add tap water to 250mL.  

Microwave on high for 2-5min, until mixture boils and agar is dissolved.  

Pour into glass petri dishes immediately, filling the dishes about half full and put lids back on dishes.  

Wrap petri dishes containing agar in tin foil, mark with autoclave tape.
